# hw3_deep_nlp

This assignment has three parts.

  • In part 1, you will implement an RNN acceptor and train it on a specific language.
  
  Part 1

  To train the RNNAcceptor model in order to distinguish the two languages of the challenge:
  - [1-9]+a+[1-9]+b+[1-9]+c+[1-9]+d+[1-9]+
  - [1-9]+a+[1-9]+c+[1-9]+b+[1-9]+d+[1-9]+
  you need to run the following command:

  ```python experiment.py order```

  • In part 2, you will explore the capabilities of the RNN acceptor.

  • In part 3, you will implement a bi-LSTM tagger.
